SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(o.unit) AS unit
FROM Products p
JOIN Orders o
    ON p.product_id = o.product_id
WHERE 
    MONTH(o.order_date) = 2
    AND YEAR(o.order_date) = 2020
GROUP BY p.product_name
HAVING SUM(o.unit) >= 100;

-- Explanation:
-- 1. JOIN Products and Orders using product_id.
-- 2. Filter orders from February 2020 using MONTH and YEAR.
-- 3. Group by product_name to aggregate units.
-- 4. HAVING clause ensures total units are at least 100.
-- Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
-- Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
-- Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
-- Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
-- Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.
